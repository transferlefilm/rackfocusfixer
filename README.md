RackFocusFixer is an application to improve the smoothness and quality of Rack Focus video sequences.
Rack Focus sequences are shallow depth-of-field camera footage in which the plane of focus shifts from one point to another in space. Unfortunately, when this shift is done manually (as opposed to using usually very expensive equipment that does this mechanically) the result can be staggered and uneven. RackFocusFixer helps you solve this issue by re-computing a smoother transition between focus points.
